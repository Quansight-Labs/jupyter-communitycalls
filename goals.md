# Jupyter Community Calls Goals

## Why Community Calls?
Our goal is have fun together to bolster the Jupyter community. It will encourage interactions across developer and co-developer communities. Jupytercon is great, but why can't we have these strong connections more frequently.

- Have fun and celebrate the cool things people do with/in the Jupyter ecosystem
- Build a closer relationship with the Jupyter community and people currently working on Jupyter tools
- Provide a meeting thatâ€™s less strictly dev so people with different skills have a more welcoming way to participate in the community
