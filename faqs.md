# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who can attend community calls? 
Anyone can attend! If you are interested in in the Jupyter ecosystem, or open 
source and scientific computing in any capacity, this is a place for you.

## How can I join in?
You can join a community call in a few different ways.
- Join us from the call link on the [README.md](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-communitycalls/#readme) 
at the time of the call to 
attend. You don’t have to turn on your camera, speak, or do anything but 
listen unless you want to.
- Share something with the community by adding to the agenda (linked on the 
[README.md](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-communitycalls/#readme)) 
before the call. This can be a quick announcement or a longer discussion, 
demonstration, or activity. 
- Help host or organize a community call. Follow the instructions on the 
[README.md](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-communitycalls/#readme) to 
reach out. You can use the resources in this repo, and you don’t even have to 
run the call alone unless you want to.

## What can I share at a community call?
Anything to do with the Jupyter ecosystem is fair game for a community call 
share (as long as it fits with the [code of conduct](https://jupyter.org/conduct/))! 
Some ideas include:
- A project you worked on (whether you were a project manager, writer, 
developer, designer, or contributor in any other way)
- One of your favorite projects made by others in the community
- Your favorite Jupyter notebook(s)
- How you use a particular Jupyterlab extension
- A new extension you developed for Jupyterlab
- A question to discuss
- The way(s) you like to use Jupyter projects
- Something we’ve never seen before

## Are there rules?
There is a code of conduct. As a Jupyter event, everyone in the call is 
expected to follow the [Project Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/conduct/).

It is also good practice to keep your microphone muted when you are not 
talking so it is easier to hear one another.

## What happened at past calls?
Community calls are recorded, so you can find out what happened on our 
[YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUrHeD2K9Cmkoamm4NjLmvXC4Y6E1o8SP) 
or read the notes on the [Project Jupyter community documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/community-call-notes/index.html). 

We try to update these sources as quickly as possible, so please be patient if 
you can’t find the most recent call.

## Why don’t you have a call at a reasonable time for my timezone?
It would be wonderful to have a community call at a good time for you! Right 
now, this is an issue of the availability of hosts. If you or someone you know 
would be interested in hosting the call at another time, please reach out 
following the instruction on the [README.md](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-communitycalls/#readme).


## What is this repository and how do I use it?
 This repository is designed to collect community call information for 
 community members to easily find. It also is the way people organizing calls 
 make sure all tasks get done. If you are organizing a call, you can find out 
 [how to use the repo here](how-to-use-this-repo.md).
