# Community call host guidelines

There’s a few things that hosts are responsible for saying during community calls:
- Community calls are recorded. 
- There is a code of conduct and people involved are held to it. If feasible, also mention where to find it.
- Thank everyone for presenting and attending. 

It is also recommended to mention the following:
- Summarize how community calls work for new participants and to set appropriate expectations for everyone.
- Introduce what’s on the agenda (even just a sentence).
- Mention the next community call date.
- Tell participants how they can can give feedback.
- Encourage people to share or host in the future.

Wondering what all those things might be like in an actual call? Here’s a potential script.

## Potential script

### At the start of the call

Hello and welcome to our [month, year] Jupyter community call. I’m [host name] and I’ll be your host today. 

This is a place to celebrate what people are doing in the Jupyter ecosystem and build connections across communities. 
There’s a couple things to know while you are here.

First, I want to remind everyone that community calls are recorded. Please keep that in mind while you’re here.

Second, I’d like to remind people that as this is a part of the Jupyter community we are all held to the Jupyter Code 
of Conduct. You can find this at any time at jupyter.org/conduct.

If you haven’t been here before, here’s how this works. Presenters have submitted what they want to share ahead of time 
and can be found on the agenda. We’ll have a little time for discussion with each one.

### Right before presenters begin

Today we’ll be hearing from [presenters and topics]. To make sure we give everyone time, each topic will get about 
[number of minutes] and I’ll be keeping track of time.

### At the end of the call

Thank you to everyone presenting and attending! I’m happy to have you all as a part of the Jupyter community.

If you have any feedback, please direct it at [platform/link]. I’d love to hear what you think about the call.

Our next community call will be [day, month]. Check out the Jupyter community calendar to see what other types of meetings 
are happening in between.

If you have any interest in sharing in future community calls, please do! It doesn’t have to be a big share, a polished share, 
or a technical share, just show off what you do with Jupyter that excites you. Submit topics here [platform/link].

If you’re interested in hosting a community call, feel free to reach out. It would be great to get different people interacting 
with the community.

## Things to remember
- The code of conduct applies to hosts too!
